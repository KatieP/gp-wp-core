<h1><strong>Ten reasons why Greenpag.es is a better deal that the other online advertising options</strong></h1>
<p><strong>1. Google Adwords</strong> you are going to bid higher and higher to increase your click through rate. Only a small amount of clicks each week will be available to you. Some Google Ads are as high as $20 per click. <em>The GP difference: On Green Pages, the most you&#8217;ll pay is $3.90 per click and many advertisers get as low as $1 / click for products that are popular with the members. </em> </p>
<p><strong>2. Facebook</strong> requires a minimum spend of $10 / day which amounts to about $300 / month which is quite steep for most small businesses. They require about a $2 &#8211; $3 per click spend. <em>The GP difference: On Green Pages, your minimum spend is $39 per month of about $1 per day (1 tenth of Facebook!). Clicks on Green Pages work out on average, cheaper than on Facebook.</em> </p>
<p><strong>3. Sydney Morning Herald</strong> charge $70 CPM for display ads, which have an ever increasingly low click through rate <em>The GP difference: On Green Pages, we charge a $30 CPM (not $70!) and we have a committed readership of environmental professionals who will see your ad, many of whom are not frequently reading mainstream news press.</em> </p>
<p><strong>4. Yellow Pages</strong> is becoming a redundant waste of paper as more and more people seek products and services online. </p>
<p><strong>5. Yelp</strong> charge per impression which is un-transparent and work out to a $150 &#8211; $200 CPM. This is around 10 times the industry average CPM rate. They don&#8217;t even show you conversion rates from impressions to clicks! They also require a 6 month commitment. <a href="http://www.raymondfong.net/misc/a-candid-yelp-advertising-review-is-yelp-ripping-people-off/"  onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackPageview','/yoast-ga/14971/2/outbound-article/']);">http://www.raymondfong.net/misc/a-candid-yelp-advertising-review-is-yelp-ripping-people-off/</a> <em>The GP difference: On Green Pages, we provide click guarantees and show your clicks and impressions transparently on your member profile. There is no time commitment and you can cancel any time. We work hard to make sure are advertising rates are less that the industry standard.</em></p>
<p><strong>6. Green Pages</strong> offers the maximum cost per click you&#8217;ll receive is $3.90 but we aim to keep it around $2.00 per click. </p>
<p><strong>7. Green Pages</strong> uses trackable links which mean our links to your site will help your SEO. <em>The GP difference: Most other sites prevent trackable outbound links. On Green Pages, we do allow links to be trackable by Google, that means your link on Green Pages will help your site&#8217;s SEO, meaning it will help you get higher up on Google&#8217;s search results. </em> </p>
<p><strong>8. We offer</strong> personalised service and will work with each client individually to ensure you get a good result for your subscription. Your $39 / month means the world to us. If you ever feel you are not getting a result, let us know and we&#8217;ll attend to it immediately to supplement your advertising. <em>The GP difference: You will always have a &#8216;real human&#8217; to call or email any time about any issue at all. We are prepared to add any supplementary promotion you need if an ad is not working well.</em></p>
<p><strong>9. Your money</strong> supports our unique content model of distributing material direct from NGO&#8217;s to a wider audience. Many NGOs rely on Green Pages is their greatest means of letting people know about the important problems they are solving. <em>The GP difference: Your money is going to support Green Pages, an independent technology company that provides the world&#8217;s only aggregate of all NGO news. We bring together the news, campaigns and projects that are saving the planet and put them in touch with thousands of people every day. The more advertisers we have, the better equipped we are to improve and built this service. </em> </p>
<p><strong>10. Greenpag.es</strong> has a loyal following of over 20,000 members and has between 400 &#8211; 1,000 visitors reading it every day. Green Pages is well known in the environmental community as a place to find environmental products and services across 400 industry sectors. <em>The GP difference: Your advertising hits the spot. The Green Pages readership is the core of the professional environmental community. There is no other membership and mailing available that has such direct access to green professionals.</em></p>
