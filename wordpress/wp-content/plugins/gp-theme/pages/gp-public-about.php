        <p>We help environmental issues snowball by helping people connect with their local environmental and 
        social change movements. Greenpag.es is a community platform that you can use to be invited to join 
        projects, read news and come to events that are happening in your local area. If you're starting something 
        up or need some support, you can post your project or event on greenpag.es to shout out to other members.</p>

        <p><em>"Never think that a small group can't change the world. In fact, it is the only thing that ever has".</em></p>
        <p>All around the world, people are creating millions of projects, campaigns and events that are devoted to 
        fixing the world. There are also millions of people who genuinely want to help. So we built a platform here at 
        <a href="http://www.greenpag.es" target="_blank">greenpag.es</a> to help people promote or to join environmental 
        and social change projects. All of the great movements started with one person meeting another person and saying 
        'What a great idea - we should do that'. The magic is sparked and a movement is born. Each successful movement 
        snowballs until it reaches a critical tipping point; <em>'The moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling 
        point'</em> when real change occurs. Greenpag.es helps millions of environmental issues reach critical mass by 
        inviting people to get involved who live in a similar region and have similar interests, to set that magic snowball 
        of social change in motion.</p>

        <h2>Green Pages lets the primary sources (experts only!) tell the story</h2>

        </div>
        <p>We noticed some time ago that not-for-profit groups produce very interesting, accurate and thorough media 
        releases. It was the 'real news' before it reached any journalist or individual. We also noticed that in many cases, 
        mainstream green media coverage wasn't too crash hot.</p>
        <p>There's an exciting movement happening on the internet right now. It's a model of 'expert-generated' content.
        A brilliant example of this new emerging model is TED.com which provides a venue, HD cameras and a designated 
        style from which experts tell their own stories direct to the audience. TED doesn't hire journalists to do the 
        job. Greenpag.es has created a similar online environment for legitimate primary sources (the experts) to 
        contribute their news updates, reports and campaign media releases to the 'news' section of greenpag.es, creating 
        an extremely high quality flow of information that comes direct from the world's environmental experts.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Green Pages is an environmental professional's best friend</h2>

            <p>Sustainability is the world's most exciting profession. Who else gets to save the world for a living? 
            Most environmental professionals such as corporate sustainability managers, environmental engineers, campaigners 
            and social change entrepreneurs check greenpag.es everyday to keep on the pulse of the environmental movement.
            Green Pages caters for the heart of the environmental profession.</p>

        <h2>Green Pages promotes green purchasing as a powerful tool for change</h2>
        <div>
            <img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-45000" title="seedlings" alt=""

        </div>
        <p>Green Pages is funded by advertising (from green products only) - but wait! It's not so bad. We believe that 
        individual people can stop environmental atrocities by changing their purchasing patterns. The more people choose 
        green friendly products and services, the more money is injected into the green economy to fuel its expansion. 
        The businesses that promote their sustainable products on greenpag.es are the kind of products that will help us 
        save the world. As consumers, we have enormous power to help many green practices to grow from a niche to an everyday 
        norm. Because big business lobbies government, each purchase can also be viewed as a political act.</p>

        <h3><a>Where and how did the company start?</a></h3>
        <p>Back in 2005 was a time before there were funky green magazines, eco blogs, triple bottom line corporate conferences,
        'sustainability managers' and progressive design agencies. The concept of 'green' was still synonymous with falafels and 
        messy hair.</p>
        <p>Newspapers very rarely wrote articles on environmental issues, often perceived as part of fringe culture. 
        Yet there was a powerful latent desire from business owners, professionals and consumers for greener business practices 
        that was starting to bubble up to the surface of corporate Australia.</p>
        <p>Green Pages founder, Katie Patrick, was a young environmental engineer working in the green property industry. She 
        saw a strong need to pull together all of the disparate environmental product information and also 're-brand' the green 
        movement as fun, sexy, cool and progressive. She had compiled a significant database of green suppliers and had started 
        to make progress towards developing a commercial green directory called Green Pages. Her main focus at that time was to 
        help architects to find sustainable materials and businesses to find eco-friendly office supplies.</p>
        <p>Katie worked out of her share-house bedroom in Sydney's inner suburb of Redfern and with little more that a bicycle, 
        a brochure and some business cards, eventually launched Australia's first print and online directory listing over 3,000 
        sustainable products and services. Starting with an annual directory, Green Pages grew to be a quarterly magazine, a 
        business directory plus an online portal of sustainable news and products.</p> 
        <p>The Directory itself grew to include over 9000 listings and the company grew to a successful 20 staff and $1.5 million 
        dollar turnover. In 2010 Green Pages made a bold move to step away from its successful print publishing business to focus 
        on a more progressive technology product.</p>
        <p>Read about this in an article written by Katie called 'Goodbye Print. Hello World'. In 2013 Katie and Jesse Browne 
        created a new San Francisco based internet startup from which they released the new global community platform for environmental
        change at greenpag.es.</p>
